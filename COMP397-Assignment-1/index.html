                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>You're a thief with a lust for gold. You were down at the local market doing your usual stealing and pickpocketing when, all of a sudden, you get bumbarded by the local guards for being a wanted man. They catch me and throw me in the highest security dungeon in all the kingdom.</p>
                <p>You knew this day would come, so you plan on your great escape from this damp dungeon. You manage to picklock your cell door and start your departure.</p>

            <div class="slide-text">
                <p>You begin to sneak down the corridor, passing cell after cell, with no guards in sight. While you continue your escape, you come across a split in the hallway. The left corridor has a light source with no guards in sight, an ideal path to see where you are going. The right corridor is pitch black where all you can hear is a rumbling sound coming from somewhere beyond the darkness.</p>

                <p>You begin your descent down the left corridor, when you come across many points of interest. You see a hole in the floor to your left, which might be a way out of the dungeon. Ahead of you there is a gate that is clearly locked, with a beam of sunlight seeping through it. To your right, you notice a slightly open door to a room. You get a strange yet good feeling coming from it, as though there are riches inside.</p>

                <p>You begin your descent down the right corridor, being as blind as a bat, relying on your other scences to guide you forward. As you go on, you relise that the rumbling sound is in fact the sound of someone snoring to the right. Could it be another captive? Maybe one of the guards?</p>
